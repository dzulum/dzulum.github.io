   We'll get you building your new website in minutes, not hours.

HTML for Absolute Beginners

   While many guides on the internet attempt to teach HTML using a lot of
   mind-boggling theory, this tutorial will instead focus on giving you
   the practical skills to build your first site.

   The aim is to show you `how' to create your first web page without
   spending the entire tutorial focusing too much on the "why."

   By the end of this tutorial, you will have the know-how to create a
   basic website and we hope that this will inspire you to delve further
   into the world of HTML using our follow-on guides.

What is HTML?

   Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to
   write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing.

   HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used
   to create pages and make them functional.

   The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we
   shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on
   teaching you how to build rather than design.

The History of HTML

   HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others
   starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

   Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader
   to jump to other places in the document or to another document
   altogether. The latest version is known as [448]HTML5.

   A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to
   control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two
   things: tags and attributes.

What are Tags and Attributes?

   Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.

   They work together but perform different functions - it is worth
   investing 2 minutes in differentiating the two.

What Are HTML Tags?

   [449]Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are
   usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: <h1>.

   Most tags must be opened <h1> and closed </h1> in order to function.

What are HTML Attributes?

   [450]Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes
   take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.

   An example of an attribute is:

   <img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog.">

   In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are
   attributes of the <img> tag.

Golden Rules To Remember

    1. The vast majority of tags must be opened (<tag>) and closed
       (</tag>) with the element information such as a title or text
       resting between the tags.
    2. When using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in
       which they were opened. For example:
       <strong><em>This is really important!</em></strong>

HTML Editors

   Now that we've gotten the basic theory out of the way. It's time to
   learn how to build our first website.

   First off, we must ensure that we have the right tools. Most important,
   we need an HTML editor.

   There are many choices on the market. Here are a handful of the most
   popular:

Sublime Text 3

   However, for this tutorial, we will use the [451]Sublime Text 3 as it
   is free and also offers cross-platform support for Windows, Mac, and
   Linux users.
   Sublime Text 3 Sublime Text 3 Sublime Text 3 has a mini-preview window
   on the right.

Pros

     * Easily customizable
     * Beginner-friendly
     * Pleasant color schemes to choose from.

Cons

     * Can't print documents or code
     * No toolbar or dashboard available.

Notepad ++

   Another common choice for HTML and other language coders is
   [452]Notepad ++. It is a tiny program to download and perform the
   functions you need for writing clean code.
   HTML Notepad ++ HTML Notepad ++ This is Notepad ++. Far from glamorous
   but does the job.

Pros

     * Distraction-free interface
     * Auto-completion feature
     * Plugin options for extended functionalities.

Cons

     * Can be difficult to get used to for beginners
     * No support for Mac.

Komodo Edit

   [453]Komodo Edit is one of two editors released by the same label. They
   offer a simple, open-source editor with a variety of extensions and
   language support.

   It is free to download.
   Komodo Editor Komodo Editor Komodo isn't one for a flash interface
   either but is simple to use.

Pros

     * Easy-to-grasp coding interface
     * Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux
     * Impressive language support.

Cons

     * No autocompletion by default
     * Visual settings are difficult to find and change.

What To Avoid

     Your code's front-end view varies from browser to browser - you will
     learn more about this with advanced CSS.

   Do not use Microsoft Word or any other word processor when writing HTML
   code, only an HTML editor or at the very least, your machine's built-in
   notepad, is suitable for the task.

   Secondly, ensure that you've installed a number of different browsers
   such as [454]Chrome and [455]Firefox in order to preview your upcoming
   creation.

Creating Your First HTML Webpage

   First off, you need to open your HTML editor, where you will find a
   clean white page on which to write your code.

   From there you need to layout your page with the following tags.

Basic Construction of an HTML Page

   These tags should be placed underneath each other at the top of every
   HTML page that you create.

   [456]<!DOCTYPE html> -- This tag specifies the language you will write
   on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.

   [457]<html> -- This tag signals that from here on we are going to write
   in HTML code.

   [458]<head> -- This is where all the metadata for the page goes --
   stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.

   [459]<body> -- This is where the content of the page goes.
   HTML Structure HTML Structure This is how your average HTML page is
   structured visually.

Further Tags

   Inside the <head> tag, there is one tag that is always included:
   <title>, but there are others that are just as important:

   [460]<title>
          This is where we insert the page name as it will appear at the
          top of the browser window or tab.

   [461]<meta>
          This is where information about the document is stored:
          character encoding, name (page context), description.

   Let's try out a basic <head> section:
<head>
<title>My First Webpage</title>
<[462]meta charset="UTF-8">
<[463]meta name="description" content="This field contains information about you
r page. It is usually around two sentences long.">.
<meta name="author" content="Conor Sheils">
</header>

Adding Content

   Next, we will make [464]<body> tag.

   The HTML <body> is where we add the content which is designed for
   viewing by human eyes.

   This includes text, images, tables, forms and everything else that we
   see on the internet each day.

How to Add HTML Headings To Your Web Page

   In HTML, [465]headings are written in the following elements:
     * <h1>
          + <h2>
               o <h3>
                    # <h4>
                         @ <h5>
                              - <h6>

   As you might have guessed <h1> and <h2> should be used for the most
   important titles, while the remaining tags should be used for
   sub-headings and less important text.

   Search engine bots use this order when deciphering which information is
   most important on a page.

Creating Your Heading

   Let's try it out. On a new line in the HTML editor, type:

   <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>

   And hit save. We will save this file as "index.html" in a new folder
   called "my webpage."

     The Moment of Truth: Click the newly saved file and your first ever
     web page should open in your default browser. It may not be pretty
     it's yours... all yours. *Evil laugh*

   Well let's not get carried away; we've still got loads of great
   features that we can add to your page.

How To Add Text In HTML

   Adding text to our HTML page is simple using an element opened with the
   tag [466]<p> which creates a new paragraph. We place all of our regular
   text inside the element <p>.

   When we write text in HTML, we also have a number of other elements we
   can use to control the text or make it appear in a certain way.

Other Key Elements

   They are as follows:
   Element Meaning Purpose
   <b> Bold Highlight important information
   <strong> Strong Similarly to bold, to highlight key text
   <i> Italic To denote text
   <em> Emphasised Text Usually used as image captions
   <mark> Marked Text Highlight the background of the text
   <small> Small Text To shrink the text
   <strike> Striked Out Text To place a horizontal line across the text
   <u> Underlined Text Used for links or text highlights
   <ins> Inserted Text Displayed with an underline to show an inserted
   text
   <sub> Subscript Text Typographical stylistic choice
   <sup> Superscript Text Another typographical presentation style

   These tags must be opened and closed around the text in question.

   Let's try it out. On a new line in the HTML editor, type the following
   HTML code:

   <p>Welcome to <em>my</em> brand new website. This site will be my
   <strong>new<strong> home on the web.</p>

   Don't forget to hit save and then refresh the page in your browser to
   see the results.

How To Add Links In HTML

   As you may have noticed, the internet is made up of lots of [467]links.

   Almost everything you click on while surfing the web is a link takes
   you to another page within the website you are visiting or to an
   external site.

   Links are included in an attribute opened by the [468]<a> tag. This
   element is the first that we've met which uses an attribute and so it
   looks different to previously mentioned tags.

The Anchor Tag

   The <a> (or anchor) opening tag is written in the format:

   <[469]a href="[470]https://blogging.com/how-to-start-a-blog/">Your Link
   Text Here </a>

   The first part of the attribute points to the page that will open once
   the link is clicked.

   Meanwhile, the second part of the attribute contains the text which
   will be displayed to a visitor in order to entice them to click on that
   link.

   If you are building your own website then you will most likely host all
   of your pages on professional [471]web hosting. In this case, internal
   links on your website will <a href="mylinkedpage.html">Link Title
   Here</a>.

Let's Create An Anchor Tag

   Let's try it out. Make a duplicate of the code from your current
   index.html page. Copy / paste it into a new window in your HTML editor.

   Save this new page as "page2.html" and ensure that it is saved in the
   same folder as your index.html page.

   On page2.html add the following code:

   <a href="[472]http://www.google.com">Google</a>

   This will create a link to Google on page 2. Hit save and return to
   your index.html page.

   On a new line on index.html add the following code:

   <a href="*folder(s)*/page2.html">Page2</a>

   Ensure the folder path to the file (page2.html) is correct. Hit save
   and preview index.html in your browser.

   If everything is correct then you will see a link which will take you
   to your second page. On the second page, there will be a link that will
   take you to google.com.

How To Add Images In HTML To Your Website

   In today's modern digital world, [473]images are everything. The
   [474]<img> tag has everything you need to display images on your site.
   Much like the <a> anchor element, <img> also contains an attribute.

   The attribute features information for your computer regarding the
   source, height, width and alt text of the image.

Styling and Formats

   Image Property Image Property You can check the file type of an image
   by right-clicking the item and selecting `Properties'.

   You can also define borders and other styles around the image using the
   class attribute. However, we shall cover this in a later tutorial.

   The file types generally used for image files online are: .jpg, .png,
   and (less and less) .gif.

   Alt text is important to ensure that your site is ranked correctly on
   search sites and also for visually impaired visitors to your site.

   The [475]<img> tag normally is written as follows:

   <img src="yourimage.jpg" alt="Describe the image" height="X" width="X">

   Let's try it out.

Create Your Own Image With An Alt Text

     Don't be afraid to play around with the test code - it's a great way
     to have fun while learning.

   Save an image (.jpg, .png, .gif format) of your choice in the same
   folder where you've saved index.html and page2.html. Call this image
   "testpic.jpg."

   On a new line in your HTML editor enter the following code:

   <img src="testpic.jpg" alt="This is a test image" height="42"
   width="42">

   Hit save and preview the index.html page in your browser.

How To Make an HTML List

   In web design, there are 3 different types of lists which you may wish
   to add to your site.

Ordered List

   The first is an [476]<ol>: This is an ordered list of contents. For
   example:
    1. An item
    2. Another item
    3. Another goes here.

   Inside the <ol> tag we list each item on the list inside [477]<li>
   </li> tags.

   For example:
<ol>
<li>An item </li>
<li>Another item </li>
<li>Another goes here </li>
</ol>

Unordered List

   The second type of list that you may wish to include is an [478]<ul>
   unordered list. This is better known as a bullet point list and
   contains no numbers.

   An example of this is:
<ul>
<li>This is </li>
<li>An Unordered </li>
<li>List </li>
</ul>

Definition List

   Finally, you may wish to include a definition list [479]<dl> on your
   page. An example of a <dl> list is as follows:

   HTML
          Hypertext markup language is a programming language used to
          create web pages and is rendered by a web browser.

   The code used for the above is as follows:
<dl>
<dt>Item</dt>
<dd>The definition goes here</dd>
</dl>

   Let's try it out. Open index.html and on a new line, enter the
   following HTML:
<p>This website will have the following benefits for my business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased traffic </li>
<li>Global Reach</li>
<li>Promotional Opportunities</li>
</ul>

   Now hit save and check out the results in your browser. If everything
   worked out then it will display a bullet-pointed table displaying the
   information above.

How To Add Tables In HTML

   HTML Tables HTML Tables Tables can be styled in various ways -
   Codepen.io offers live previews to keep track of changes.

   Another way to keep your website looking neat and orderly is through
   the use of a table.

     Do not use a table to layout your website. Search engines hate it
     and it is generally a bad idea. Just... don't. See our [480]CSS
     tutorial, instead.

   This is definitely the most complicated part of this tutorial, however,
   learning it will certainly pay off in the long-run.

   With this in mind, tables can still be a useful way to present content
   on your page.

What Does a Table Consist Of?

   When drawing a table we must open an element with the [481]<table>
   opening tag. Inside this tag, we structure the table using the table
   rows, [482]<tr>, and cells, [483]<td>.

   An example of an HTML table is as follows:
<table>
<tr>
<td>Row 1 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 1 - Colunm 2 </td>
<td>Row 1 - Column 3 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Row 2 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 2 - Column 2</td>
<td>Row 2 - Column 3</td>
</tr>
</table>

   This will produce a 2-row table with 3 cells in each row.

   Tables can get quite complicated, so be sure to check out our special
   [484]HTML tables tutorial.

   However, watch out for these tags so that you can recognize them and
   use them as your skills develop.

   Here are the tables tags presented in a table - pun totally intended.
   Table Tag    Meaning               Location
   <thead>    Table Head   Top of the table
   <tbody>    Table Body   Content of the table
   <tfoot>    Table Foot   Bottom of the table
   <colgroup> Column Group Within the table
   <th>       Table Header Data cell for the table header

   Tables, borders, spacing are usually [485]styled using CSS but we will
   cover this in a later tutorial.

Let's Make a Table

   Go to a new line on the index.html page within your text editor. Enter
   the following HTML code:
<table>
<tr>
<td>Row 1 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 1 - Column 2 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Row 2 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 2 - Column 2</td>
</tr>
</table>

   Hit save and preview it in your browser.

   Congratulations: You did it!

   The final step we need to complete is to close the <body> and <html>
   tags at the end of each page using the following HTML code:
</body>
</html>

   these features and link them together.

   We suggest that you further enhance your skills by experimenting with
   the code you've learned using different variables. You may also wish to
   learn about how to make your pages beautiful using [486]CSS.

   The power to create your own website is now in your hands.

Our Other HTML Tutorials

   Our HTML tutorials teach you how to create a personal website or site
   for your business, without forcing you to learn unnecessary theory.

   Our most popular beginner's tutorials include:

   [487]HTML tables

   These tutorials guide you through the process of creating tables for
   your exact needs. Tables were once the primary means by which pages
   were laid out.

   With the adoption of CSS, this is no longer necessary. And for good
   reason, because this created pages that were almost impossible to
   maintain. But for the purpose of display tables, HTML offers all the
   tools you will need.

   [488]Links

   There's a lot more to links than just moving from page to page. In this
   tutorial, you will learn how to navigate pages and download files.

   You'll also learn how to make your links as user-friendly as possible.
   Links are the core of HTML so this is important stuff.

   [489]Forms

   Forms are important for marketing as well as creating web applications
   and more.

   This detailed tutorial will guide you from the very basics to the most
   advanced uses of forms with CSS and JavaScript.

   [490]Fonts

   At one time, the font was an HTML tag and it made creating maintainable
   web pages a nightmare. Now we use CSS to set fonts and their attributes
   like weight, style, and size.

   And by using CSS, you can set the look of your pages consistently with
   the ability to radically change them by changing just a few lines of
   code. This tutorial explains all.

   [491]Images

   With the use of the img tag and CSS, you can do just about anything you
   want.

   But with HTML5, you have the addition of the picture and figure
   elements. Find out how to do images right with this thorough tutorial.

Intermediate & Advanced Tutorials

   We've plenty of topics for intermediate and advanced HTML learners,
   too:

   [492]CSS tutorials

   CCS, Cascading Style Sheets, allow you to design and ornament your web
   pages.

   This tutorial takes you from the beginning to being fluent in CSS so
   that you can create complex pages that are easily maintained.

   [493]JavaScript
   HTML Javascript HTML Javascript Javascript is often used to add dynamic
   elements (like this countdown clock) to web pages.

   JavaScript is arguably the most important web coding language after
   HTML. Most websites you visit employ at least a little bit of
   JavaScript coding.

   Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript makes the trinity of webpage design
   and construction.

   This tutorial assumes you know nothing and gets you going with this
   essential programming language. It even introduces you to advanced
   subjects like AJAX and jQuery.

   [494]HTML5

   Video: This 3 minute crash course is a great way to start understanding
   HTML5.

   HTML5 has revolutionized webpage markup with things like semantic and
   multimedia elements. Find out all about the new goodies that are
   waiting to be explored.

   [495]Semantic Markup

   This tutorial introduces you to semantic markup that allows you to
   construct pages so that their structure reveals their content.

   This is especially useful as search engines become more and more
   advanced -- allowing them to find users the right information they are
   looking for.

   [496]Logical tags

   You may have noticed that few people use the i tag for italics and
   instead use the em tag.

   This is because the i tag is just a formatting tag and thus should
   really be accomplished with CSS. The em has meaning: the text is
   emphasized.

   Logical tags like em and cite are important in the same way as semantic
   markup. Find more in this brief discussion.

HTML Reference Guides

   Meanwhile, our detailed [497]HTML tags reference lets you find out more
   about every single HTML tag from [498]<a> to [499]<xmp>.

   JavaScript in order to do anything. This page provides all the details
   you need.

   Links are far more powerful than new HTML coders realize. Find out all
   you need to know to make the greatest use of the a tag.

   [502]Link Tag

   The link tag can be confusing because it is easy to mix up with "links"
   (defined with the a tag).

   But link is a very powerful tag that allows you to link an HTML
   document to an outside resource like a CSS file. Find out all you need
   to know here.

   [503]Image Manipulation
   IMG Code Example IMG Code Example This is an image code with various

   some JavaScript, you can change images on the fly.

   This tutorial shows you how.

   [504]Character Codes

   Another great aspect of HTML is its ability to use non-keyboard keys
   like ® (&amp;reg;) and © (&amp;copy;).
